<!-- <h1>CryptoMeetup项目说明</h1>

<h3>1. 开启新一轮测试</h3>
<p>下一轮测试开放249个国家，每个国家Token的起始价格是 0.1 EOS，每次购买使得该国家的价格增长35%。下一次购买的金额先返回上一个玩家的本金，并将增值部分按照如下比例进行分配：</p>
<ul>
  <li> 50%给到上一个玩家 </li>
    <li> 30%给到CMU持币者 </li>
    <li> 10%进入奖池 </li>
    <li> 5%给上一轮测试中站岗的 </li>
    <li> 5%给推荐人 </li>
</ul>
<p> 新一轮的测试中加入了倒计时，每次购买行为都将重置倒计时。倒计时时间跟奖池大小相关，遵从 t = 1 min+24 hrs - 奖池 / 2000 * 23.59 hrs，从24小时递减到1分钟。</p>

<p> 注意：倒计时结束时，最后一个购买的玩家获得奖池，所以土地信息将被删档。用户持有的CMU不受影响。</p> -->
